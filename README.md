# Stocks-analysis

  ## - Overview of Project
  
  #### Our friend Steve who's just graduated with his finance degree came to us because his parents wanted to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. But Steve thinks that his parents funds should be more diversified, so he wants to analyze several green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO stock.
  #### So with the Excel file he gave us, we automated tasks through an extension of Excel: Visual Basic (VBA). We prepared a workbook to helped him know how DAQO performed in 2018, and at the click of a button he can now analyze an entire dataset, but now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years.
  #### For this request we refactored our code in Visual Basic to made the VBA run faster, so Steve can work with a larger amount of data. This also means make the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.
